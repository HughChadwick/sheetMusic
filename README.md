Sheet music website
The idea of this website is to hold music data in ABC format and then render PDF sheet music versions of this music.

The underlying principals are that is should:
  Be object orientated.
  Comply with the SOLID design principals.
  Adhere to the PEAR coding standards
  Be well commented (enough but without too much).
